# compute JS divergence / draw prediction distributions

```
python draw_pic_xxx.py: draw prediction distributions of retrain & unlearn models on 10 samples

python xxx_JSdivergence.py: compute JS divergence of the predict probability on test dataset by unlearn model and retrain model.
```

* models/resnet.py should be in the directery before xxx_JSdivergence.py is executed
