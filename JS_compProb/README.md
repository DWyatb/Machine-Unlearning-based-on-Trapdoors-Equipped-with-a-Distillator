# compute JS divergence / draw prediction distributions

```
xxx_JSdivergence.py: compute JS divergence

draw_pic_xxx.py: draw prediction distributions of retrain & unlearn models on 10 samples

draw_pic_xxx_sample4.py: draw prediction distributions of retrain & unlearn models on 1 sample (4th data is picked)
```

* For NEG, RandomLabel, BadT: 
JSmodule.py should be in the directery before xxx_JSdivergence.py is executed
